.with_mosaic(...)

what default resolution?

how to test
how to implement sources for tile dataframes

self.source[self]

where to start downloading from source?

problem is, zoom is dependent on the source or input dir

is name necessary?

stitch.

mabye Tiles.from_integers

should stitch to /tmp/

'/tmp/tile2net/nyc/z/x_y.png'
/tmp/tile2net/nyc/stitched/z/x_y.png

cfg.trace2property

cfg should also be a dict so the user can see all specified values

how to update cfg?

tile2net/resources/assets/weights/

where to download?

loader
predictor
writer


check util/trnval_utils and misc.py

There are many scattered classes with methods that require a global `cfg` variable. We are trying to move
away from this global variable. We need to update the __init__ of these classes to require `tiles` as a parameter.
We can type hint the Tiles class without importnig it using this:

if False:
    from tile2net.tiles.tiles import Tiles

then in the init we have a parameter `tiles: Tiles`. We store it as a variable, and we also use it for the cfg.
The cfg is available from `cfg`. For example, here:

if cfg.DATASET.TRANSLATE_AUG_FIX:

This is better off as:

if tiles.cfg.dataset.translate_aug_fix:

I need you to go through all of the tile2net/tiles/tileseg directory and update these classes to use the new tiles object passed.
Note that the tiles:Tiles is a positional argument and cannot be returned as None. Do not fall back to `cfg`.


stuff like this is quite unappealing to read:
        slid_mask = add_margin(mask, top, right, bottom, left,
                               self.ignore_index)
If the parameters cannot fit on one line, I much prefer them to be one-per-line, with the argument name specified like so:
        add_margin(
            pil_img=mask,
            top=top,
            right=right,
            bottom=bottom,
            left=left,
            margin_color=self.ignore_index
        )

Go through all of tile2net/tiles/tileseg and update any method calls to use this new, vertically expanded style.

1. if starts with _ just do object.get
2. if hasattr(cls, item) then object.get/set/del
3. try adding to trace
