profile the inference

dump_dict['assets'].keys()
Out[3]: dict_keys(['pred_05x', 'pred_10x', 'attn_05x', 'predictions', 'prob_mask'])

how to determine whether or not to force

todo: problem is we are keeping the config globally;
    this can allow for unpredictable behavior if the user uses multiple instanes in the
    same session

use a _flush=True parameter in the constructors

we need global cfg and local cfg
during inference, we push local cfg to global cfg with a context manager
if anything fails, we restore the global cfg

with self.cfg:
    self.cfg is set to the global cfg
    global cfg original values are stored elsewhere
    self.cfg is literally the global cfg

    self.infer()

if we have Cfg inherit from dict, we cannot change the object that the global cfg is accessing
but if we have a private dict internally, then we can swap them around

todo: debug self.dimension

we choose a crs for to postpocess in

union polygons
    overall network
feature polygons (mutex)
    feature network

t       cl_arg      cl_arg/2        .1
simpl   1           1               .5


union.polygons
union.network

feature.polygons
.feature.network

exclude road in the centerline computation

pednet.lines -> gets union polygon

pednet.center.stubs

todo: why come iline=542 is a stub

810 is not a terminal?
