    "## City Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "Tile2Net creates a grid of the bounding box of the input city following the Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) standards. You can access both grid level information, as well information about each individual tiles. This grid is used to download tiles, stitch every n tiles together, stitich all tiles in the bounding box to create a large image, among other operations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To create the data object for your region, you need to pass:\n",
    "<strong>location</strong>: The textual address or bounding box coordinates for your region (e.g. 'Washington square park, Manhattan, NY, USA' ), or a list of coordinates in the form [lat, lon, lat, lon].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional parameters:\n",
    "<strong>input_dir</strong>: The path to the input directory, implicating the format of the files, containing the xtile, ytile, and extension, and possibly containing the zoom level, e.g. `path/to/tiles/z/x/y.ext` or `path/to/tiles/x_y.ext`; If not specified, the tiles will be downloaded from a remote source. If input_dir is passed, the zoom must be passed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>output_dir</strong>: The directory where you want to save your data. If not specified, the data will be saved in a folder under your system's temp directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>name</strong>: Choose a name for your project-region; this name will be used as the base name of the folders for your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>The remaining attributes are not particularly important for the purposes of this tutorial:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>base_tilesize</strong>: The size of the tiles in pixels. The default is 256, which is the standard size for Web Map Tile Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>zoom</strong>: The zoom level of the tiles. The default is 19, which is the highest zoom level for Web Map Tile Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>crs</strong>: The coordinate reference system of the tiles. The default is 4326, which is the coordinate reference system for WGS84.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>stitch_step</strong>: The number of tiles to stitch together. The default is 1, which means that no stitching will occur. If you want to stitch every 2 tiles together, you would pass 2. If you want to stitch every 4 tiles together, you would pass 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>boundary_path</strong>: The path to a shapefile that will be used to filter out tiles that are outside the boundary of the shapefile.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>padding</strong>: Whether or not to pad the tiles. The default is True, which means that the tiles will be padded to the size of the base_tilesize. If you want to use the original size of the tiles, you would pass False.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>extension</strong>: The extension of the tiles. The default is 'png', which is the standard extension for Web Map Tile Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>dump_percent</strong>: The percent of segmentation images to dump to the subdirectory 'segmentation/seg_results': 100 means all, 0 means none. The default is 0.\n"
